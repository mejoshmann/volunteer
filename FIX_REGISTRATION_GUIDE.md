# 🔧 Fix Registration Issue - Email Confirmation

## Problem

Registration is failing because Supabase requires email confirmation by default, but users can't confirm their email immediately.

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've updated the registration code to handle email confirmation properly. Users will now:
1. Register successfully
2. Get a message to check their email
3. Click the confirmation link in their email
4. Then they can log in

## 🚀 Quick Fix for Development (Disable Email Confirmation)

For easier testing during development, you can disable email confirmation:

### Steps:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**
   - Click "Authentication" in left sidebar
   - Click "Providers"
   - Find "Email" provider

3. **Disable Email Confirmation**
   - Toggle OFF "Confirm email"
   - OR set "Confirm email" to "Disabled"
   - Click "Save"

4. **Test Registration**
   - Try registering a new volunteer
   - Should work immediately without email confirmation!

## 📧 For Production (Keep Email Confirmation Enabled)

**Recommended for production:**

### Setup Email Confirmation:

1. **Configure Email Templates**
   - Go to: Authentication → Email Templates
   - Customize "Confirm signup" template
   - Add your organization's branding

2. **Setup SMTP (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Go to: Project Settings → Auth
   - Scroll to "SMTP Settings"
   - Configure with:
     - SendGrid (free tier: 100 emails/day)
     - AWS SES
     - Mailgun
     - Or other SMTP provider

3. **Test the Flow**
   - Register a test account
   - Check email for confirmation link
   - Click link → should redirect to app
   - Login works!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting "Invalid login credentials"

**Solution 1: Check Email Confirmation Status**
```
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Authentication → Users
3. Find the user
4. Check "Email Confirmed" column
5. If "false" - user needs to confirm email
6. You can manually confirm: Click user → "Confirm email"
```

**Solution 2: Disable Email Confirmation (for development)**
```
Follow steps above in "Quick Fix for Development"
```

**Solution 3: Check if user exists**
```
1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Look for user's email
3. If exists but can't login → reset password or delete and re-register
```

## 📱 Email Templates (Production Setup)

### Confirm Email Template Example:

**Subject:** Confirm your Freestyle Vancouver volunteer account

**Body:**
```html
<h2>Welcome to Freestyle Vancouver Volunteer Portal!</h2>

<p>Hi {{ .Email }},</p>

<p>Thank you for signing up to volunteer with Freestyle Vancouver!</p>

<p>Please confirm your email address by clicking the link below:</p>

<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Confirm your email</a></p>

<p>If you didn't create this account, you can safely ignore this email.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you on the slopes!</p>

<p>
Thanks,<br>
Freestyle Vancouver Team
</p>
```

## 📞 Still Having Issues?
