# 📧 Email Confirmation Issue - Complete Fix Guide

## Problem

You're experiencing:
1. ✓ Register → Get confirmation email
2. ✓ Click link in email → Redirected to app
3. ✗ Try to login → "Email not confirmed" error

## Root Cause

The email confirmation link isn't properly confirming the email in Supabase. This usually happens due to:
- Incorrect redirect URL configuration
- Email confirmation still enabled but not working
- Confirmation link expired or malformed

## ✅ Quick Fix (Recommended for Development)

### Disable Email Confirmation Completely

**This is the easiest solution for development/testing:**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to Email Settings**
   - Click "Authentication" in left sidebar
   - Click "Providers"
   - Find "Email" provider

3. **Disable Email Confirmation**
   - Toggle OFF "Confirm email"
   - Click "Save"

4. **Test Registration**
   - Try registering a new user
   - Should work immediately without email confirmation!
   - Can login right away

### Clear Existing Users (If Stuck)

If you have users stuck in "unconfirmed" state:

1. **Option A: Manually Confirm**
   - Go to Authentication → Users
   - Click on the user
   - Click "Confirm email" button
   - User can now login!

2. **Option B: Delete and Re-register**
   - Go to Authentication → Users
   - Find the user
   - Click "..." → Delete user
   - Register again (will work immediately with confirmation disabled)

## 🔧 Production Solution (If Keeping Email Confirmation)

### Step 1: Configure Redirect URLs

1. **Go to Authentication → URL Configuration**

2. **Set Site URL:**
   ```
   Development: http://localhost:5174
   Production: https://your-domain.com
   ```

3. **Add Redirect URLs:**
   ```
   Development: 
   http://localhost:5174/**
   http://localhost:5174
   
   Production:
   https://your-domain.com/**
   https://your-domain.com
   ```

4. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Update Email Template

1. **Go to Authentication → Email Templates**

2. **Click "Confirm signup"**

3. **Verify the template uses:**
   ```html
   <a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Confirm your email</a>
   ```

4. **Update Subject Line:**
   ```
   Confirm your Freestyle Vancouver volunteer account
   ```

5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 3: Test the Flow

1. **Register new user**
2. **Check email** (check spam folder!)
3. **Click confirmation link**
4. **Should redirect to app and auto-login**
5. **If not auto-login, try logging in manually**

I've updated the app to:
- ✅ Better handle email confirmation events

## 🚀 Quick Commands

FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Manually Confirm Email:
```sql
UPDATE auth.users 
SET email_confirmed_at = NOW() 
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

DELETE FROM auth.users

AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
```

## 📧 Email Template Example

For when you DO use email confirmation:

**Subject:**
```
Confirm your Freestyle Vancouver volunteer account
```

**Body:**
```html
<h2>Welcome to Freestyle Vancouver!</h2>

<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>Thanks for signing up to volunteer with us!</p>

<p>Please confirm your email address by clicking the button below:</p>

<p>
  <a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}" 
     style="background-color: #2563eb; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; 
            text-decoration: none; border-radius: 6px; display: inline-block;">
    Confirm Email Address
  </a>
</p>

<p>Or copy and paste this link:<br>
{{ .ConfirmationURL }}</p>

<p>This link expires in 24 hours.</p>

<p>If you didn't create this account, you can safely ignore this email.</p>

<p>See you on the slopes!<br>
