## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do I have to add each shift separately?**
A: No! Use the "Download All" button to import all your shifts at once.

**Q: Will this update if I remove myself from a shift?**
A: No, you'll need to manually delete that event from your calendar. The calendar entries don't sync back to the website.

**Q: What if I sign up for more shifts later?**
A: Just use "Download All" again, or add individual shifts as you sign up.

**Q: Can I change the reminder time?**
A: Yes! After importing, edit the event in your calendar app to set custom reminders.

**Q: What if my calendar app isn't listed?**
A: Try "Apple Calendar" option - the .ics file works with most calendar apps!

- [ ] Custom shift duration (some may be longer/shorter than 2 hours)
- [ ] Automatic calendar sync (remove if volunteer cancels)
