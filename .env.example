# Supabase Configuration
# Your Supabase credentials are already hardcoded in src/lib/supabase.js
# In production, these should be moved to environment variables

# Admin Credentials
# IMPORTANT: Change these default credentials immediately!
# Use a strong, unique password for production
VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_strong_password_here

# Security Notes:
# 1. Never commit .env file to version control (it's in .gitignore)
# 2. Use different credentials for development and production
# 3. Consider implementing role-based authentication through Supabase instead
# 4. Regularly rotate admin passwords
# 5. Use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords
